  <posting title="Assigner Tech">
If assigner is set to true here, you can accept these missions!
It's very useful to have just the posts though, and use this style of board for infodumps, story, or research targets.

The board algorithm will try and load every xml file in the folder, so only put articles you want in it, and don't include computers!
