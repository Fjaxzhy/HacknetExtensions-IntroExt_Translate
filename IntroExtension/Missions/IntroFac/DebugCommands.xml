    <body>To Autostart your mod while in development, start Hacknet with the argument
-extstart [YOUR_MOD_FOLDERNAME]

To start Hacknet on your second monitor, if you have one, use the argument
-altmonitor

You probably also want to develop with force complete on:
-enablefc

Debug commands too:
-enabledebug

Once you have Debug commands enabled:

fh
Instantly breaks into any computer

dscan [ID]
reveals a computer by ID name

ra
reveals everything on the netmap at once

reloadext
reloads all the nodes in the current extension from source files,
and updates them in the current save.
