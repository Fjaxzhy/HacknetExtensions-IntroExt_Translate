    <body>Custom songs can be played with the mission function "playCustomSong:[SONG_PATH]"
You can also use playCustomSongImmediatley:[SONG_PATH] to skip the fade between songs and start it immediately.

Songs must be in Ogg Vorbis (.ogg) format!

Also note that for now, songs will not work on the XNA branch - this is because the .ogg format handling code is done within FNA, so the XNA version doesn't have the code to support those files.
I'll address this when I can, but due to how few people use that branch, it's a lower priority for now. Sorry!

You can also do this from conditional action sets, using the "runFunction" tag.

Open up this mission to see the playCustomSong tag working for this one!

      <note title="XNA Branch Exception">.Ogg files will *NOT* work on the xna branch!
A strategy for this is to specify a base game song to play first, the instantly override it with your desired custom song - this way XNA players will still get a music change.</note>
