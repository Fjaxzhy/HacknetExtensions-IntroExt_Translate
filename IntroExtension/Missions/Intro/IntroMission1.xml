    <subject>Welcome to Hacknet Extensions</subject>
    <body>Hey,
Thanks for checking out the mod tools. This extension will run your through how the tools work, and get you started on your own projects.
For this guide, I strongly recommend playing in windowed mode.

Each extension has a folder in /Extensions next to Hacknet.exe
That folder needs to contain ExtensionInfo.xml to define it as a mod - this contains basic setup stuff.

The folder containing the extension you're looking at right now is:
#EXTENSION_FOLDER_PATH#

To complete this mission, navigate to that folder, then move to the subfolder containing this mission and open it:
Missions/Intro/IntroMission1.xml

At the top of that file, you'll see a goal of type "getstring". Reply with the text in the "target" field to continue.

Good to have you with us,
-Matt
