    <body>The computer defined in Nodes/ExampleComputer.xml is essentially a reference guide for computers. It contains all features that are supported for a computer to have, and a description for each outlining how to use them.

It's linked below so you can see how it all comes together. Note that there's a lot there - this isn't meant to be a typical computer, but a demonstration of *everything* that's available.
A good way to use this is to copy and paste the relevant parts of this that you want on your own computer and modify them from there.

Take a look through this, and compare how the file format converts into something tangible ingame.

Once you feel like you understand it enough to move on, reply here with the exact number of seconds that the trace timer takes for that computer.
