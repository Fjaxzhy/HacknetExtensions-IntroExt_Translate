    <body>Excellent work - lets get to it then.
    
First up, Computers.

From the base folder of this extension, go to the "Nodes/Intro" folder.
From there, you can find the file defining the computer that's linked below. It's named:

Mission2TestNode.xml

Open the up and have a look at how a computer is defined in XML. If you don't know how XML works, don't worry, there'll be a guide for that later.
For now, just get used to looking at the format, and try and recognize how things in that file map to what you see in-game.

For the next step, find the admin pass for that computer in the file, log in, and download the programs that are on it.
