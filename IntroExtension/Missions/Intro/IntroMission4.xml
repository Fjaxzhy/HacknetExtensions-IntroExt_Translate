    <body>Similar to the example computer in the previous mission, I've included an ExampleMission.xml file outlining all of the possible things you can include in a mission.
    
You can find that file in the IntroExtension/Missions folder.

Again - remember that this isn't a typical mission file - when making your own missions, it's probably a better idea not to copy this file and remove what you don't need -instead, keep it clean by taking a smaller mission, and adding in or changing what you want.
This stops there being walls of comments that are all the same everywhere. Still, that's your choice to make.

I wont be assigning the mission in that file, as it's basically impossible to complete (having so many different goals), but the comments should describe how it all works.

When you think you have a handle on it, respond with the name of the file to delete to complete the "fileDeletion" goal of that mission.
