    <!-- This goal will auto-complete in 5 seconds, to make the reply times seem more natural!
    Remember to note that it also has activeCheck set to true above, so that it checks every frame,
    otherwise the player would have to click reply, but only after 5 seconds, which would be very confusing.-->

    <body>You replied abort to the mission, and are now on the abort-branch!
This will have no impact on anything this time, but you can make these take wildly different story branches if you want,
or do clever things like adding flags etc here that makes the game remember what choices the player made.

Use these later with conditional actions and flag checks to do things!</body>
