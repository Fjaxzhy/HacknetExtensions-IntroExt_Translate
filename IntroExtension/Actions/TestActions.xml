    <!-- When developing an extension, it can be useful to have a conditional action on an early mission (This one is loaded at the start of IntroMission1.xml) 
    I used this one for test during development!
    
    
    Other handy dev tricks: Have a branch mission from one of your very early missions that has a getString goal that skips you straight to endgame, or wherever you want.
    This is handy because you can leave it in for standard testing and only remove it for full release.
    
    I also highly recommend making a test server that contains a bunch of programs, or whatever daemon you're testing at an easy to connect to name.
    Base game hacknet uses "test" - you can get there with just "connect test" even still!
